# BatchScripts
This repository contains batch scripts that I have written for personal use to make my life easier!
# install.bat
This is a batch script using Chocolatey (https://github.com/chocolatey) to install my base software that I use on my machines for development and personal reasons. It installs Chocolatey and then installs the software.
# JDABaseInstall.bat
At my current company (JDA) we use git and whole bunch of other tools and I took it upon myself to create a batch script that can be reused by new developers/QA or people who get new machines to get our software products that we use quickly. It also uses chocolatey and also prompts the user on whether or not they would like to install the software.
