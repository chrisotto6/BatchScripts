# BatchScripts
This repository contains batch scripts that I have written for personal use to make my life easier!
# install.bat
This is a batch script using Chocolatey (https://github.com/chocolatey) to install my base software that I use on my machines for development and personal reasons. It installs Chocolatey and then installs the software.
